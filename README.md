# NSEF
Nessus Securityfocus Exploit Finder

The reports generated by the vulnerability scanner Nessus contains SecurityFocus references. Most of the time, those references
contains available exploits. It will take a lot of time to check one by one reference, so I though in a temporal solution.

The idea about this script is to check all the findings from the nessus report, visit all the security focus references and check
if those have available exploits. Based on that, The pentester will save time in order to find exploits related to the findings
from the nesus reports.

Note: This is a beta script.
